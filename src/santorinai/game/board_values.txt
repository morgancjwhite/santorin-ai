BASIC NOTATION

The Santorini board consists of 5x5 squares and to simplify how we refer to the board state, we have gone with the following notation:
A-E for the x axis, going from left to right.
1-5 for the y axis going from top to bottom.

A1 therefore refers to the square in the top left of the board.
C4 refers to square in the middle column and 2nd from the bottom.
D6, J2, P are examples of invalid grid positions
(the alpha component of this notation is case-insensitive)


VALUES

0 in the grid represents an empty spot
1 represents the first level of the Santorini architectural wonder
2 represents the second level
3 represents the third (and winning) level
4 represents the fourth (and blocking) level
